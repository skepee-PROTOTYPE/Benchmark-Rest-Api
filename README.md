# Benchmark Rest API
C# console to benchmark a Rest API for Get, Post, Put and Delete verbs.

# Why this tool
Sometimes a benchmark of your api is needed, and you may need to test the api wherever is located, in production or localhost, to check whether a refactoring is needed or to investigate some architectural aspects.

This tool through command line helps you to run your api as many times as you want and generates a statistic for you.

## How to use
It can be run in command line by invoking the command `BenchmarkRest` and passing the following arguments:

`BenchmarkRest myurl numTimes method [startingIteration]`
- *url*: Rest api resource
- *numIterations*: number of times to use *url* resource.
- *httpVerb*: indicates which verb we want to benchmark (Get, Post, Put, Delete). It accepts one the following values (uppercase or lowercase it doesn't matter):
  - Get, g
  - Post, po 
  - Put, pu
  - Delete, del, d
- *apiParams*: parameters used for Api in json format. In particular:
  - Post, Put: params will be passed in Body
  - Get, Delete: params will be passed in url

## Log file
Once the command runs with the right parameters, a console log will be displayed and a log file is generated at the end of the *numIterations* iterations. 
The log file is generated by using the following packages:
- [ILogger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) 
- [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog)

## Injections
- IHttpClientFactory 
- ILogger

## Statistics calculation
For each iteration of *numIterations* a stopWatch instance is instantiated and if some data returns with status code 200, the elapsed time is calculated.
The elpased time for each iteration is in memory and at the end of all iterations the following statistics will be calculated:
- Max()
- Min() 
- Avg()

# Use of invoking command:
apiParams contains parameters for the api. For example by passing the following Json:
`{\"portfolioId\":\"10\"}`
the api will use `portfolioId` as parameter with value equals to `10`.
`numIterations` determines then ending value of `portfolioId`. If `numIterations` equals to `5`, `BenchmarkRest` will run with `portfolioId` having values between `10` and `15`.

In this way, the following commands will use `portfolioId` as parameter with values between `10` and `30`
- `BenchmarkRest https://abc 20 g {\"portfolioId\":\"10\"}`  : 20 times a GET from `https://abc` (`https://abc/10` ... `https://abc/30`)
- `BenchmarkRest https://abc 20 po {\"portfolioId\":\"10\"}` : 20 times a POST from `https://abc` passing in body `portfolioId` with values between 10 and 30
- `BenchmarkRest https://abc 20 pu {\"portfolioId\":\"10\"}` : 20 times a PUT from `https://abc` passing in body `portfolioId` with values between 10 and 30
- `BenchmarkRest https://abc 20 d {\"portfolioId\":\"10\"}`  : 20 times a DELETE from `https://abc` (`https://abc/10` ... `https://abc/30`)
